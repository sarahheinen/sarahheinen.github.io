	<div class="entry2">
		<p>After two years as a first degree black belt, I tested for and earned a second degree on my black belt.  It is the next step in the journey of ten degrees.  I completed this achievement under Grandmaster Sam Perez, at Denison Family Karate Center.</p>
		<p>This test was similar to my first degree black belt test.  We were tested both physically and on our knowledge.  We completed a set number of exercises before the test began.  We demonstrated every form we’d learned up through first degree black belt, as well as recited the definitions and meanings of the Korean names of these forms.  We showed the kicks, blocks, and self-defense we’d learned up through first degree black belt.  Lastly, we sparred four opponents, taking each down while defending against the others.</p>
		<p>On the board were Grandmaster Keith Yates, Grandmaster Larry Wheeler, Grandmaster Sam Perez, Grandmaster Caroline Goodspeed, and six other black belts in A-KaTo (American Karate and Taekwondo Organization).</p>

	<div class="entry1">
		<p>This was my first tournament in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu.  I competed with Grappling Industries in Pittsburgh, PA, with Andrew Pardee coaching.  While I didn’t win any medals, I learned a lot about my strengths and weaknesses, and what to work on going forward.  The tournament was a round robin, with Gi and NoGi matches.  I competed in four Gi matches and four Nogi matches.</p>

	<div class="entry1">
		<p>I earned my first stripe in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu at Andrew Pardee Brazilian Jiu Jitsu in Weirton, WV.  This is the first promotion I received in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, and so it was a moment to remember.  The belt ranking system is the following order: white, blue, purple, brown, black.  Each belt has four stripes that can be added (five ranks per belt total).  </p>

	<h3>First Dan Black Belt</h3>
	<h5>September 21, 2019</h5>

	<div class="image">
		<img src="/pictures/FirstDanBlackBelt.jpg" alt="First Dan Black Belt">
		<h6>Peter Heinen, Grandmaster Perez, Sarah Heinen</h6>
	</div>

	<div class="entry1">
		<p>I earned my first dan black belt in Taekwondo at Denison Family Karate Center.  This is the first of ten degrees of black belt.  The Japanese and Korean names for first degree black belt mean "first step".  It is a goal many people seek, but it is only the beginning of a lifelong journey.  After six years of training, I earned the "first step" in my black belt journey.
		</p>
		<p>
		The belt test consists of both physical challenges and tests of knowledge.  Before the belt test began, were required to complete a set number of exercises.  During the test, we demonstrated what we learned in the years leading up to our first degree black belt.  This included forms, kicks, and self-defense, as well as definitions of Korean terms and history of Taekwondo.  We also demonstrated our sparring and takedown abilities against four opponents.</p>
