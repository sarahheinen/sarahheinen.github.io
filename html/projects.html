		<p>I participated in a hackathon put on by <i>Women in Computer Science</i> at UT Austin.  I participated with their virtual option, joining workshops via Zoom.</p>
		<p>The category I submitted my project for was "Carnival Hacks".  I wrote a Python text-based game based on the matching ducks carnival game.  In this game, the player selects two ducks from the pool, and if the ducks have matching numbers, the player wins.</p>
