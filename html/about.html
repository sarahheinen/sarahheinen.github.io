	<h2>About Me</h2>
	<p>Hi! I am a Sophomore at Franciscan University in Steubenville, OH.  I am majoring in Computer Science, with minors in Sacred Music and Mathematical Science.  I've primarily worked in Python, and have some experience in HTML/CSS.</p>
	<p>My main musical instrument is piano, and I have experience playing violin, organ, and singing.  I teach private piano lessons online.  I also have experience accompanying choirs.</p>
	<p>I recently earned my Second Dan Black Belt in Taekwondo.  I also train Brazilian Jiu Jitsu and Mixed Martial Arts.  </p>
